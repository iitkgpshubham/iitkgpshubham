# About Me
Hello !

I am **Shubham Kumar**, a 3rd year undergraduate student at *IIT Kharagpur*. I am doing my major in *Instrumentation Engineering* at the department of Electrical Engineering IIT Kgp.

Currently, my objectives are getting both theoretical and practical knowledge in core domains of analog, digital, signal processing and embedded systems via hands-on-learning.
I am actively looking forward for the opportunity to contribute in the related projects that helps me expanding my knowledge domain and get invaluable experience of real projects.
Apart from that, I also solve algorithmic programming problems.
